# Weather_App
## Project Overview
This weather application offers two primary features: fetching weather data based on the user's current location and allowing users to enter any location to retrieve its weather information. Built using React, the app leverages a combination of user input, geolocation, and API interactions to provide real-time weather updates.

## Key Features
Geolocation API Integration: Automatically fetches the user's current geographic location using the browser's Geolocation API.

Weather Data Retrieval: Uses the location to request weather data from an external weather API and displays the current weather information for the user's location.

User Input: Allows users to manually enter a location into an input field.

Weather Data Fetching: Submits the entered location to the weather API and retrieves weather information for that specified location.

Loading Spinner: Displays a spinner or loading indicator while weather data is being fetched, providing visual feedback to users.
